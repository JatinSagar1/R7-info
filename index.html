        <p id="para" class="para">I make it a point to tell everyone who is willing to listen (and even some who aren’t) how much fun the new Yamaha R7 is. While most people get up in arms about the name of the bike, I’m over here having a blast actually riding the thing, preferably at a race track. I said as much during my First Ride Review of the R7 back in May, too. What the R7 brings to the table in terms of elevating the MT-07 platform for track duty – all for under $9000 – is truly impressive.</p>
        <p class="para">No, its 689cc parallel-Twin isn’t super powerful, nor does it have top-class suspension or brakes. What it does have, though, is entirely adequate for learning the ropes. In my opinion, this is what makes it an excellent training tool for the sport or track rider who wants to learn proper technique instead of relying on horsepower. It demands smoothness, and when you don’t deliver, it communicates in ways other bikes, with their better components, will simply mask.</p>
        <p class="para2">That’s all well and good, but for as fun as the R7 is on a track, we can’t forget that it still has lights, mirrors, turn indicators, and a license plate. It is a street-legal motorcycle, after all – which is exactly what the focus groups Yamaha consulted wanted. Considering we haven’t yet taken an R7 off the track and onto the roads, we decided this would be as good a time as any to do so. If we think back to the kind of motorcycle Yamaha built in the R7 based on focus group feedback, then we recall what’s essentially a “usable” R6. In other words, a sportbike in appearance and attributes but with an engine and powerband the average user can access on the street. In other words, an engine with midrange torque.</p>
        <p class="para2">Here’s where we have a problem. If you know me, then you know how much I think Sportbikes are Terrible on the street. The low clip-ons that are great on track are torturous while cruising around. Maybe that’s my age talking since I know there are plenty of riders who disagree. They must be the ones who responded to Yamaha’s focus group invite. Anyway, aside from the clip-ons, the R7’s chassis changes (compared to the MT-07) are important enough to see just how well the little bike handles the roads. Click on the First Ride link above to learn more about those little changes, but in short, some slight geometry tweaks and a slightly more rigid chassis are the big differences between the MT-07 and R7. <br> Riding the R7 around town gets the kind of reaction out of me as you probably expect – it’s not very fun. The reason is exactly what I mentioned before: the clip-on bars. With them mounted below the triple clamps, it puts weight on your wrists and makes it a little difficult to keep a loose grip on the bars. Not to mention, after a while, the strain on your wrists gets annoying. For some, it could even be mildly painful. Clearly, this makes it less than optimal for freeway cruising. Then again, all you have to do is look at the R7 to realize its intent is sport and track riding. The R7 is not pretending to be something it’s not. It’s foolish of me to expect anything else.</p>
